BLOG PAGE
In this page, you're going to create four blog posts.
The task here is to implement in-page linking such that someone can
jump from one blog post to the next.
For example, at the end of the first blog post, you can place a link 
where someone can click, to gotto the last blog post.
Like: <a href="#fourth_post">GOTTO THE FOURTH BLOG POST</a>

For the link to locate the fourth blog post and go there, you need to
place an id with the same name at the beginning of the fourth blog post
You can wrap the id at the caption of the fourth blog post.
Like: <h2 id="fourth_post">FOURTH BLOG POST</h2>
Try to make your blog post lengthy so you can see the effect of the
link.

Implement this for the other blog posts as well.

Wrap your blog posts in div tags and give each a different background
color.

Move all the images in those pages to the index.html page.
